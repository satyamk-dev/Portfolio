                <p>ðŸ‘‹ About Me
                    Hello! I'm Satyam Kumar, a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Java Developer from Ranchi, Jharkhand. I recently completed my B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering and a Diploma in Computer Science, and Iâ€™ve been building practical, real-world web applications ever since.

                    With hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, MySQL, React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, I specialize in building robust, scalable, and user-friendly applications. My projects include clones of Amazon and Udemy, a Weather App, a TODO app, and a Hospital Management System using Spring Boot and MySQL.

                    Iâ€™ve also interned at Jindal Steel and Power where I developed a web-based notice board system â€” an experience that helped me understand how technology powers real-world operations.

                    When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, cooking, or dancing alone â€” I believe a balanced life boosts creativity and focus.

                    Iâ€™m always eager to learn and open to new challenges and opportunities in software development. Letâ€™s connect and build something amazing!
